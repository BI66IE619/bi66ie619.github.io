HOW TO PLAY (its not as easy as you think): So once you click the "Launch Terrarai Web Port" button, 2 tabs will open. There will be a drive link (Content.zip - Google Drive) tab and the main game tab (Terrariun). Your going to first download the Content.zip folder from the drive link and your gonna extract it. Next, your gonna go to the Terraria game tab and your gonna click "Copy local assets". Then your gonna click "Select Terraria Content directory" and choose the "Content" folder you extracted earlier. Next your gonna wait for the green bar to load and then once its loading, it may or may not show something similar to "game not playing". So if you do end up seeing this, click the "Play" button on the top right corner. Then lastly, wait for the game to load and play fullscreen (which is reccommended) and enjoy!
